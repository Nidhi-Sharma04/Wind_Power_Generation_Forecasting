## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting wind power generation using machine learning techniques. Wind power generation is highly dependent on meteorological factors such as wind speed, temperature, and atmospheric pressure. By leveraging historical data, we aim to develop a predictive model that can estimate future power generation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
- Performance evaluation of the predictive model

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Dataset--kaggle
The dataset contains historical wind power generation data along with meteorological parameters. It is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling before feeding it into the model.

## Model Development
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and transformation of data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting key features that impact wind power generation.
4. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
5. **Evaluation**: Using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score to assess model accuracy.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nidhi-Sharma04/Wind_Power_Generation_Forecasting.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Wind_Power_Generation_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models for better accuracy
- Incorporate real-time wind data for live forecasting
- Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning
